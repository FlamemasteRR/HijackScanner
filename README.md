Building

Requirements:
1. Windows
2. Visual Studio (2013 and above)

Also ensure that:

The default installation folder is chosen so the build tools can find it

If using Visual Studio make sure Visual C++ support is selected/installed

A git command is in your path

Set the GYP_MSVS_VERSION environment variable to the Visual Studio/Build Tools version (2013 or 2015) e.g. [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("GYP_MSVS_VERSION", "2015", "User") in PowerShell (or set it in Windows advanced system settings).

You can download code and use it in projects by copying them from source files or, if you want to use project, fork it.
